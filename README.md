## How the Game works :



### The player will have to guess the answer,  This time, though, the player will guess with numbers instead of letters.Here's how the app works:


### There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.


### The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.


### When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score.




### The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.


### The player loses if their score goes above the random number.


### The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.
